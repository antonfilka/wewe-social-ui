# Project Guidelines

## Commits naming

-   Keeping up with conventional commits naming, so that they are clear for everyone - https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## Creating new form

-   Use `react-hook-form` to manage form state
-   Use `zod` for validation schemas
-   Keep schema in a separate `schema.ts` file in the same folder with form component

## Styling

TODO: Sync global css variables with Ant design theme colors

-   Ant design is used as a main ui library for now
-   Use `clsx` when importing styles from css modules or managing conditional styles
-   To avoid auto zoom (on mobile browsers) on inputs focus set font size at least 16px
